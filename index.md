<br>
<h3>Volunteer Teaching</h3>
<p>During term breaks, I volunteered in various teaching trips to rural areas globally, covering Hong Kong, Taiwan, Guilin, Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), Phnom Penh (Cambodia), and Trà Vinh (Cambodia). I've participated in 10+ voluntary services, accumulating 400+ service hours, benefiting 300+ students. Also, I joined the <a href="https://www.un.org/millenniumfellows/">United Nations' Millennium Fellowship 2021</a> to promote equal education.</p>

<h3>Mandarin Debate</h3>
<p>As a member of both the PolyU and Cambridge Mandarin Debate Teams, I participated in competitions across various cities, including Singapore, Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, Changsha, Xi'an, and Chengdu. These experiences refined my communication and critical thinking skills and provided international representation opportunities.</p>
