## About Me

I am a first year Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge, working under the supervision of [Prof. Nigel Collier](https://sites.google.com/site/nhcollier/home). Previously, I completed my MPhil degree at Cambridge, focusing on fact-checking under the guidance of [Prof. Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io/). During my undergraduate studies, I collaborated with [Prof. Wenjie Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cswjli/) on conversational QA systems.

My interests span various Natural Language Processing tasks, as long as they're not the kind that easily get replaced by GPT-4 (or GPT-5 in the future :cold_sweat: )!

And that's a wrap - for now, at least until AI learns to write these bios too!
